Welcome to my blog! This is where I write about topics such as web APIs, hypermedia, and HTTP. These are things I've spent countless hours researching and experimenting with since 2018, so I hope to save my readers time by providing insight I've accumulated on these subjects. Additionally, I hope readers find this blog thought provoking and inspires them to explore and learn.

This site is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima), and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).
