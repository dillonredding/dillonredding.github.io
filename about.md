My name is Dillon Redding and welcome to my blog 👋 I'm a professional programmer, web developer, software engineer, or whatever the term is for someone who writes code for a living 👨‍💻 I believe knowledge isn't meant to be hoarded, but rather shared freely for the benefit of all, which is why I started this blog. My goal is to impart my knowledge and insight to readers, while learning how to organize and express my thoughts through writing. I hope readers find the content here thought provoking and feel inspired to explore and learn.

The articles I post here cover topics such as web APIs, hypermedia, and HTTP. I'm a huge proponent of creating an excellent, intuitive developer experience (DX), so these are things I've spent countless hours researching and experimenting with since 2018.

This site is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima), and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).
