My name is Dillon Redding and welcome to my blog 👋 I'm a professional programmer, web developer, and software engineer 👨‍💻 I believe knowledge isn't meant to be hoarded, but rather shared freely for the benefit of all, which is why I started this blog. My goal is to impart my knowledge and insight to readers, while learning how to organize and express my thoughts through writing. I hope readers find the content here thought provoking and feel inspired to explore and learn.

At the moment, the articles I post here primarily cover web APIs, HTTP, and hypermedia. I find great interest in these topics as they define the peripheral interaction layer of web-based software and therefore have a profound impact on developer experience (DX) as well as on how dependent systems are able to grow, evolve, and adapt to changing requirements.

This site is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima), and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).
