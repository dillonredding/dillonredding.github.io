# My Blog

This is where I get my ideas out of my head and onto "paper", exploring, rambling about, and generally nerding out about software development.

Built with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com), [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), and [the Leap Day theme](https://github.com/pages-themes/leap-day).
